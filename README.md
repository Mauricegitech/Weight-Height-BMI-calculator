🧮 BMI Calculator
A lightweight, user-friendly tool to calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI) using weight in kilograms and height in centimeters. It shows the BMI value and a category label (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese) for quick interpretation.

📖 What is BMI?
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple measure that uses height and weight to estimate whether a person’s weight falls within a healthy range. It’s a general screening tool—not a diagnostic of health. For personalized guidance, speak with a healthcare professional.

✨ Features
Instant calculation: Enter weight (kg) and height (cm) to get BMI immediately.

Clear categories: Displays standard BMI ranges (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).

Input validation: Prevents empty or invalid entries.

Responsive UI: Clean layout suitable for desktop and mobile.

Lightweight code: Minimal HTML/CSS/JS—easy to read and extend.

🧠 Formula
BMI formula:

BMI
=
weight (kg)
(
height (cm)
100

🧩 Usage details
Inputs:

Weight (kg): positive number

Height (cm): positive number

Output:

BMI value: rounded to one decimal place

Category: based on standard ranges

📊 BMI Categories
Underweight: BMI < 18.5

Normal: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 25

Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 30

Obese: BMI ≥ 30

These ranges are general guidelines and may not account for age, sex, muscle mass, or medical conditions.

🧪 Testing tips
Try edge cases: very low/high values, empty inputs, non-numeric entries.

Check rounding: ensure one decimal place for consistency.
